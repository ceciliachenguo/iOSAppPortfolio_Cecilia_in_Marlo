**Marlo** is a üìç **location-based social media iOS App** that I developed at work from 0 to 1. <br/>
  This innovative app connects users to events within specific areas and times, offering a unique platform for social engagement and event discovery. <br/>
  The APP is available on the TestFlight and Apple App Store: <br/>

## About
For those unable to download the app, I've used this space to showcase the main features and user interfaces I've developed. <br/><br/>
Extensively utilizing SwiftUI and Combine, I've crafted aesthetically pleasing user interfaces adhering to functional programming principles. Where iOS functionality constraints arise, I've employed UIKit to address these challenges effectively. <br/><br/>
I can't show the code due to a non-disclosure agreement, as I want to remain professional and respect my team members' efforts. While I understand that my  side projects hosted on other repositories might have a very different level of complexity, decision-making, and problem-solving level compared to a large project like this, I would be happy to answer more general questions about the overall architecture of the project I'm working on during interviews. <br/><br/>
The App incorporates a variety of interesting tools and frameworks, and I would be delighted to discuss the frameworks that I'm proficient in with you! <br/><br/>

### üîé Post Detail Interaction
- Here, users can view the event's attendees, attached images, and details. Furthermore, users can interact with the post by commenting, sharing the post within nearby areas, adding the event to their calendars, sharing the post link with other applications, and requesting to attend the event.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Fancy Text Editor
- Here, users can create their own posts using a rich text editor I developed, which enables the addition of clickable URLs, time ranges, and locations for enhanced interactivity. Additionally, users have the option to add verification questions for those wishing to attend. Lastly, the feature to share posts is also available.

### üì¢ Others
- In addition to the main features, the app also offers Chatrooms, sectioned Notifications, Profile pages, and much more for you to explore! <br/><br/>

## Note
I am actively engaged in debugging to fix bugs and continuously adding new features to the app. 

Email or Message me if you found a new bug in the App. üòÑüòÑüòÑ
